ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
ralfherzog-20070803/mfc/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE
