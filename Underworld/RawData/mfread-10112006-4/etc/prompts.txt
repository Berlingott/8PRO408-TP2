a0001 Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc
a0002 Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore
a0003 For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
a0004 Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil
a0005 Will we ever forget it
a0006 God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever
a0007 And you always want to see it in the superlative degree
a0008 Gad, your letter came just in time
a0009 He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table
a0010 I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
a0011 If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now
a0012 Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet
a0013 He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique
a0014 Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed
a0015 It's the aurora borealis
a0016 There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep
a0017 From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy
a0018 There was a change now
a0019 I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances
a0020 Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
a0021 It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
a0022 Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
a0023 A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
a0024 It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
a0025 I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
a0026 It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
a0027 To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
a0028 Robbery, bribery, fraud,
a0029 Their forces were already moving into the north country
a0030 I had faith in them
a0031 They were three hundred yards apart
a0032 Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
a0033 He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson
a0034 Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children
a0035 He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes
a0036 She turned in at the hotel
a0037 I was the only one who remained sitting
a0038 We'll have to watch our chances
a0039 The ship should be in within a week or ten days
a0040 I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
